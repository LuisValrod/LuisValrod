<p>Former Rockstar ðŸ˜…, I'm now someone who's always up for learning new things and taking on challenges. During my thirteen years as a teacher, I developed some pretty useful skills like paying close attention to detail, tackling complex problems, communicating effectively, and getting creative with solutions. These skills have been super helpful in my switch to becoming a full-stack developer. It's a field where I found a spark that reignited my passion and motivation for continuous learning and skill enhancement. </p>
