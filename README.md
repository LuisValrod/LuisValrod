*I am an enthusiastic and ambitious individual who thrives on learning and embracing new challenges. Over my thirteen-year tenure as a teacher, I honed valuable skills such as meticulous attention to detail, the ability to dissect complex problems, effective communication, and creative problem-solving. These skills have proven invaluable in my transition to a full-stack developer, a field where I discovered a spark that reignited my passion and motivation for continuous learning and skill enhancement.*
